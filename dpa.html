                            <p>1.1 In the course of providing the Services to the Controller pursuant to this Agreement, the Processor may process personal data on behalf of the Controller. The Processor agrees to comply with the following provisions with
                                respect to any personal data processed for the Controller in connection with the provision of the Services.</p>
                            <p>1.2 The Processor shall process personal data it receives from the Controller solely for purposes stemming from usage of Service and for no other purpose except with the express written consent of the Controller.</p>
                            <p>1.3 The Processor shall process categories of data subjects which are provided to the Service by the Controller. Processor is not entitled to process any category of data without prior demand or consent of the Controller.</p>
                            <p>1.4 Types of personal data. Contact information, the extent of which is determined and controlled by the Controller in its sole discretion, and other personal data such as navigational data (including website usage information),

                            <p>1.5 Subject-Matter and nature of the processing. The subject-matter of processing of personal data by the Processor is the provision of the Service to the Controller that involves the processing of personal data. Personal data
                                will be subject to those processing activities as may be specified in the <a href="index.html">Showtag AS Privacy Policy.</a></p>
                            <p><b>2. Data protection</b></p>
                            <p>2.1 As the performance of this Agreement implies the processing of personal data, both Parties shall comply with the applicable data protection legislation and regulations including GDPR.</p>
                            <p>2.2 The Controller will ensure that its instructions for the processing shall comply with applicable data protection legislation and regulations including GDPR. Controller shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality,
                                and legality of personal data and the means by which Controller acquired personal data.</p>
                            <p>2.3 The Controller agrees that with regard to the processing the Processor may engage Sub -processors compliant with data protection legislation and regulations including GDPR (general consent). Where the Processor engages
                                another Sub-processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the Controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in this Agreement shall be imposed on that Sub-processor by way of a contract
                                or other legal act under applicable data protection legislation and regulations including GDPR.</p>
                            <p>2.4 The Processor shall ensure that any personal data that it processes are kept confidential. All persons authorized by the Processor to process the personal data are under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality and
                                not disclose the personal data to any person other than to its personnel.</p>
                            <p>2.5 The Processor shall ensure that it implies appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of applicable data protection legislation and regulations including
                                the protection of the rights of the data subject.</p>
                            <p>2.6 In accordance with GDPR regulation as the performance of this Agreement the Processor shall in particular:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>create and maintain a record of its processing activities in relation to this Agreement; the Processor shall make the record available to the Controller, any auditor appointed by it and/or the supervisory authority
                                        on first request;</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with the monitoring of the personal data breach obligations resulting from applicable data protection legislation and regulations including GDPR, taking into account the

                                </li>

                                    <p>promptly notify the Controller about (i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a data subject, a judicial or regulatory authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as the obligation under
                                        criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a judicial enquiry, and to assist the Controller therewith (ii) any accidental or unauthorized access, and more in general, any unlawful processing and to assist the
                                        Controller therewith;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>at the choice of the Controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the Controller after the end of the provision of Service relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless applicable data protection
                                        legislation and regulations requires storage of the personal data;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations resulting from this Agreement;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>inform the Controller immediately if it believes that any instruction from the Controller infringes applicable data protection legislation and regulations;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        the Controller.</p>

                            <p>2.7 As the transfer of personal data is necessary for the performance of the Service provided by the Processor the Parties shall ensure that the personal data are adequately protected as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR.
                                In particular the Processor collects and transfers personal data subject to this Agreement by the Controller to fulfil a compelling legitimate interest of the Processor in a manner that does not outweigh Controller’s nor
                                end users rights and freedoms. The personal data safeguard system is described more in detail in <b><a href="index.html">Showtag AS Privacy Policy</b></a>.</p>
