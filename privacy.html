                            <p>We only collect information that cannot be directly related to individuals. Showtag only collects non-personal information.</p>
                            <p>2.1. Non-personal Information:</p>
                            <p>Non-personal information, which is being gathered, consists of technical information and behavioral information that does not pertain to a specific individual (“Non- Personal Information”).</p>
                            <p>You can use our services without disclosing personal information, although, like most services, we passively collect certain Non-Personal Information which may include the user’s click-stream, the activities of the user in
                                the plug-in and additional information of a similar nature (collectively, “Technical and Behavioral Information”).</p>
                            <p>3.2.1. Personal Information which is provided voluntary:</p>
                            <p>Showtag only acts as a conduit for this personal information and doesn’t store any personal information you provide to your video service provider. For personal information of the kind above, the privacy policy of the video
                                service provider applies</p>
                            <p>3.2.2. Personal Information collected via technology:</p>
                            <p>Geolocation data and the identity of your company: while using the Site we will access, collect, process, monitor and/or remotely store "geolocation data", including through the collection of IP addresses and other similar
                                information to determine your location for the purpose of providing a localized version of our some of our templates and for security purposes.</p>
                            <p>Technical and Behavioral Information: to the extent that the Technical and Behavioral Information detailed above under Section 3.1 will be linked to or associated with a specific individual then such information will be considered
                                as Personal Information.</p>
